# Gradient_Realm

Gradient_Realm is a Python-based project that implements various regression techniques and optimization methods using both scikit-learn and custom implementations. The goal is to explore and compare methods such as Regularization techniques, Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Mini-batch Gradient Descent, offering a hands-on understanding of their working principles.
